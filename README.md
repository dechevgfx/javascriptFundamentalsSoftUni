Programming Fundamentals with JavaScript

The course examines fundamental concepts in programming, which are the basis 
for effective and quality training in professional modules. Students upgrade 
the knowledge gained in the Programming Basics course and begin to use more 
complex programming techniques and structures such as: arrays, sheets, objects and classes.
Additional technologies needed by each software developer, such as HTML and CSS, HTTP,
bitwise operations and others, are studied. The basics of web development are considered,
as well as one of the most common technologies and tools, with which the course successfully
builds students' understanding of the upcoming professional modules and the knowledge
they will acquire from them to become successful software developers.
